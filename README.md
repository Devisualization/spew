# System Propergation of Event Wells (S.P.E.W.)

So what is an Event Well, you may ask. Well good question.
I don't quite know, but it has something to do with creating events at a higher level then the system that created them and propergating them to a nice user (developer) interface.

In the end what exactly are the goals for S.P.E.W?
Well not much, just a unified event loop, bindings and of course interfacing to OS constructs that can have major performance impact like windowing.

So why should we take you seriously? After all glib exists. Well, you're still reading this aren't you.
